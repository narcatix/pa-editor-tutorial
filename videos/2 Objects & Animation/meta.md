## 📐 About
Project Arrhythmia is a fun rhythm bullet-hell game in which all things beautiful are deadly. One of the appealing features of this game is its robust level editor. In this tutorial/course I will explain the basics, walk you through creating a simple level, and by the end you will have enough knowledge to start making and publishing your own creative levels.
