## 📐 About
Project Arrhythmia is a fun rhythm bullet-hell game in which all things beautiful are deadly. One of the appealing features of this game is its robust level editor. In this tutorial/course I will explain the basics, walk you through creating a simple level, and by the end you will have enough knowledge to start making and publishing your own creative levels.

## ℹ️ Important Notes
```
4:42 Since PA version 24.3.2 default level setup includes *two* objects, as shown on the screen.

Something I should have explained in this lesson is the ‘E/C’ tab. The name stands for *Effects & Checkpoints* and allows you to add and animate visual effects with keyframes, and add Checkpoints. One of the effects is ‘*Theme*’ which lets you change the set of colours for background, nanobots, UI, and Gameplay Objects.
