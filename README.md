## 🏁 Goals
1. **Accessibility**. The video series would have *at least* English captions available, use easy-to-understand graphics, and the audio track would not rely on video and can be just listened to without confusion (i.e. no "look where I'm pointing" and "click here"). The tutorial would also be available as a written guide and hosted on multiple web services.
2. **Ease of keeping it up to date**. Videos would be arranged in a playlist. If an update of a video is required, it would be easy to unlist the outdated video and replace it with a new one. Every video would have a section in the beginning warning viewers/listeners that the video they've been linked is outdated and a new one is available. Those sections would be hidden using a YouTube video editor feature until needed. GitHub and Wiki pages can be easily updated by the community.
3. **Usefulness**. The tutorial would be friendly and informative, targeting both newbies and returning creators.

I'm planning to release the tutorial as:
* A GitHub page:
 * An MD file to be linked to as a written version of the tutorial
 * Video script source
 * (Maybe) Video editor project files
* A YouTube playlist
* A Steam guide
* (Maybe) A Discord message thread on this server and on Heartbeat Central.
* (Maybe) projectarrhythmia.wiki.gg page

## 📚 Guidelines
Script editing guidelines:
- Terminology
	- "User" must refer to the user of the editor
	- "Players" must refer to potential people playing user's level, and always pluralised
	- "Nanobot" must refer to characters that players control
	- "Objects" are more abstract, while "Shape" is a visual representation of an object
- Avoid giving ideas of location by referring to the video. Assume the user is only able to listen to narration.
- Follow the writing tone
	- Helpful
	- Friendly
	- Precise
